            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Lambert Wilderness got its start over 60 (?) years ago with the help of Bill Lambert.(he started it- not helped) Soon after his return home from WWII, Bill found a teaching job in (wasilla before Fairbanks). Fairbanks and moved to Alaska with his wife, Carol "Sweetpea" Lambert. (Like the nickname /human , its humanizing) Bill and Carol quickly fell in love with the mountains, and in 19?? they purchased a small plot of land in the Alaska Range. (Not sure if they actually purchased it or homesteaded iit. Know they got horses and bought the camper and horse trailer before buying camp. Lots of family trips that way). </p>
